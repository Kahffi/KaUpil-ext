**Currently only supports firefox with manual installation**

2 Version available: main and experimental

- main: you need to open each classes manually then use the extension to autofill the form.
- experimental: automatically fill all the classes, still kinda buggy (nothing dangerous (i hope)) sometimes it won't start, you might want to clear the local storage and reload the extension

main feature(s):
- randomize score with range (1-9)
- that's it =D

i wanted to develop it further but the experimental feature makes me complete the questionaire while doing the test (duh).
Maybe wait until next semester for an update ;D

**How to install**: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/
**Select experimental/main version from the branch of this repository**
